A self-directed hands-on learning approach to building an automated georeferencing data processing pipeline segment for newly collected optical satellite imagery. 


In learning how to georeference satellite imagery, I've been curious how this might be built into an automated process. In short, let's take a fresh collect (recently captured satellite image) with the platform ephemeris (gps location and attitude of satellite location at collect time) and build a process that can be invoked to get at least a vaguely accurate spatial coordinate projection for that scene.
